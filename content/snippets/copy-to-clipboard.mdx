## Introduction

> This tutorial provides a straightforward method to add a copy-to-clipboard button in an MDX file within a Next.js application.

## Technology

- **MDX:** A powerful markup language that combines the best of Markdown and JSX, allowing you to write content with components and logic.
- **Next.js (App Router):** A React framework for building server-rendered and static web applications with routing and data fetching.
- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Bright:** A modern React server component for syntax highlighting

## Setup

### Next Mdx Remote

Next Mdx Remote is a library that allows you to load MDX files remotely, making it easy to create dynamic content that can be updated without redeploying your application.

To use Next Mdx Remote, you can install it using the following command:

```
npm install next-mdx-remote
```

Once installed, you can import it into your application and use it to load MDX files from a remote URL:

```
import { MdxRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <MdxRemote
      src="https://example.com/my-mdx-file.mdx"
    />
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This will load the MDX file from the specified URL and render it as a React component.

### Custom Components

You can add custom components to your MDX files using the `<MdxRemote.Components>` component. This allows you to define your own components that can be used within your MDX content.

For example, you could define a custom component for a copy-to-clipboard button as follows:

```
import { MdxRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote';

const CopyButton = () => {
  // Logic for copying text to clipboard
};

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <MdxRemote
      src="https://example.com/my-mdx-file.mdx"
      components={{ CopyButton }}
    />
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This would allow you to use the `<CopyButton>` component within your MDX file as follows:

```
<CopyButton />
```
