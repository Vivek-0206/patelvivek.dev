## Introduction

If you've ever built web applications that involve **forms** , **real-time updates** , or **complex data interactions**, you know the struggle can be real. Traditionally, these features often required setting up separate `API` endpoints and managing intricate client-side state. Next.js 14 Server Actions come to the rescue! They provide a smooth solution, allowing you to execute server-side logic directly from your React components, just like calling a regular function.

Let's explore how Server Actions can supercharge your development workflow and make your apps feel more responsive and interactive.

## Setup NextJs

`Prerequisites: Nodejs, Database(Supabase)`

Create a new Next app with :

```bash
npx create-next-app server-actions
```

we also use [shadcn ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next). It is a collection of re-usable components.

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

For the database we use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). It is an open source Firebase alternative.

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```
